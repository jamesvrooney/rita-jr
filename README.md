# real intelligent technological application (rita)

rita is a realtime search engine that takes dealchecker searches, some realtime partners and returns deals for those partners.
rita's engine is quite generic. All you have to do is develop handlers for the partners you want it to handle and you're ready to go.

Born from the ashes of _kicktrip_, it is smaller and more maintainable. It should also be **scalable**, so if you want to
spawn a bunch of them to handle different products you should be able to do so.
